## 🔄 One Final Step: Create Database Tables

You need to create the Supabase tables manually (one-time setup, 2 minutes):

### Quick Instructions:

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**:
   - Visit: https://doocpqfxyyiecxfhzslj.supabase.co
   - Click **"SQL Editor"** in left sidebar
   - Click **"New Query"**

2. **Copy & Run this SQL**:

```sql
-- Create splits table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS splits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  contract_address TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  owner_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  factory_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create recipients table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS recipients (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  split_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES splits(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  wallet_address TEXT NOT NULL,
  percentage INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (percentage > 0 AND percentage <= 100)
);

-- Create indexes for better query performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_splits_owner ON splits(owner_address);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_splits_contract ON splits(contract_address);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_recipients_split ON recipients(split_id);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE splits ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE recipients ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies to allow public read/write access
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access on splits" 
  ON splits FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert on splits" 
  ON splits FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow public read access on recipients" 
  ON recipients FOR SELECT USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow public insert on recipients" 
  ON recipients FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);
```

3. **Click "Run"** - Should see success message

4. **Verify**: Go to "Table Editor" → You should see `splits` and `recipients` tables

## 🚀 Start Your App!

After creating the database tables, you're ready to test:

```bash
cd app
npm run dev
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Phase 1: Wallet Connection
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000
- [ ] Click "Connect Wallet"
- [ ] Connect with MetaMask/Coinbase Wallet
- [ ] Switch to Base Sepolia network if prompted
- [ ] See your address in navigation

### Phase 2: Create a Split
- [ ] Click "Create New Split" on dashboard
- [ ] Add 2-3 recipients (use test addresses)
- [ ] Set percentages that sum to 100%
- [ ] Click "Deploy Split"
- [ ] Approve transaction in wallet
- [ ] Wait for confirmation (~5 seconds)
- [ ] See your split appear on dashboard

### Phase 3: Fund Distribution
- [ ] Click on your split to view details
- [ ] Copy the split contract address
- [ ] Send 0.001 ETH to the split address
- [ ] Watch auto-distribution happen
- [ ] Verify recipients received funds on BaseScan
- [ ] Check transaction history in the app

### Phase 4: Multiple Recipients
- [ ] Create another split with different percentages
- [ ] Test with 4-5 recipients
- [ ] Verify all get correct amounts
- [ ] Check all transactions on BaseScan

## 📊 What Can You Do Now?

### Fully Working Features:
✅ **Connect Wallet** - Via Reown AppKit (MetaMask, Coinbase, WalletConnect, etc.)
✅ **Create Splits** - Deploy your own split contracts
✅ **Auto-Distribution** - Send ETH, it splits automatically
✅ **Manual Distribution** - Trigger distribution manually if needed
✅ **Dashboard** - View all your splits
✅ **Transaction History** - See all past distributions
✅ **BaseScan Integration** - Verify everything on-chain

### Example Test Addresses (for testing):
```
Recipient 1: 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb
Recipient 2: 0xdD2FD4581271e230360230F9337D5c0430Bf44C0

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

### For Production (Base Mainnet):

1. **Get Real ETH on Base Mainnet** (~$5-10 for deployment)

2. **Deploy to Mainnet**:
   ```bash
   cd contracts
   npm run deploy:base
   # Note the factory address
   ```

3. **Update Frontend**:
   ```bash
   # Edit app/.env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SPLIT_FACTORY_ADDRESS_BASE=0x...
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID=8453
   ```

4. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Push to GitHub (already done!)
   - Connect repo to Vercel
   - Set environment variables
   - Deploy!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Transaction Failed"
- Make sure you're on Base Sepolia network
- Check you have enough ETH for gas
- Verify percentages sum to exactly 100%

### "Cannot Connect Wallet"
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache
- Switch to Base Sepolia manually in wallet
- Check Reown Dashboard for any issues

### "Database Error"
- Make sure you ran the SQL in Supabase
- Check both tables exist in Table Editor
- Verify RLS policies are enabled

### "Contract Not Found"
- Verify factory address is correct in .env.local
- Check you're on Base Sepolia network
- Confirm contract on BaseScan
